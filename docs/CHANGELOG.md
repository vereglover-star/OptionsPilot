## 2026-07-16 — V2-3: AI Mode vs Human Mode

*310 tests. Frontend live-verified in a real browser (mode toggle + persistence
across reload, Coach tab empty state, full manual round trip → coach review
rendered with expandable detail, mode-axis orthogonality) against a scratch
data directory before committing.*

- `EngineConfig.operating_mode`: `"ai"` (default, autonomous trading) or
  `"human"` (AI scans and advises only; never places an order). Instant,
  no-restart switching via `RuntimeSettings.set_operating_mode()`,
  independent of `trading_mode`.
- `Orchestrator`: in Human Mode, tradeable signals become one-time "advice"
  notifications per bar instead of orders.
- New manual-trade reconciliation loop: detects opened/closed
  `managed_by="manual"` positions cycle-to-cycle, captures analysis context
  while open, rebuilds the round trip from broker fill + order history on
  close, journals it, and generates a `TradeCoach` review.
- New `optionspilot/coach/` package:
  - `coach.py` — `TradeCoach.review()`: before/during/after breakdown,
    14-tag mistake taxonomy (each with a pro-comparison note and a concrete
    exercise), **process-based** 0–100 score (deliberately rewards
    discipline over luck — a stopped-out loser with a plan outscores a
    reckless winner).
  - `profile.py` — `CoachProfile.build()`: aggregates all reviews into
    recurring mistakes, strengths, score trend, win rate by setup quality,
    recommended exercises.
- New API: `POST /api/operating_mode`, `GET /api/coach`.
- New UI: header AI/Human segmented toggle, Coach tab (cards, mistakes
  panel, strengths/exercises panel, expandable review detail).
- New tests: `tests/test_coach.py` (13 tests), `tests/test_human_mode.py`
  (mode switching + full manual round-trip integration).

## 2026-07-16 — V2-1 & V2-2: windowed desktop app + manual trading engine

*Commit `0ce001d`, roadmap update `bec78fb`. 296 tests.*

**V2-1 — true desktop application:**
- PyInstaller `--windowed` build: no console window on launch.
- Generated candlestick app icon (`scripts/make_icon.py` →
  `assets/optionspilot.ico`).
- Single-instance guard: a localhost-port mutex; a second launch shows a
  friendly notice window instead of two processes fighting over the same
  SQLite files.
- Logging skips the console `StreamHandler` when `sys.stderr` is `None`
  (true in a windowed build).

**V2-2 — order engine + manual trading:**
- New `broker/orders.py` `OrderManager`: MARKET, LIMIT (option premium),
  STOP_LOSS / TAKE_PROFIT / TRAILING_STOP (underlying price levels,
  put-aware direction mirroring), DAY (expires 16:00 ET) / GTC time-in-force,
  position scaling, reservation checks (prevents overselling across bracket
  orders), auto-cancel of exit orders when the position closes first,
  SQLite persistence with restart-safe fills (uses live quotes on restart,
  never stale stored prices).
- `Position.managed_by: "ai" | "manual"` — `PositionManager` (AI) now
  explicitly skips manual positions.
- `PaperBroker.open_manual()` — plan-less entry path for manual trades.
- Equity snapshots persisted per cycle for lifetime max-drawdown / total-
  return metrics.
- New API: `GET /api/chain` (option chain with Greeks + liquidity score for
  the order ticket), `GET/POST /api/orders`, `POST /api/orders/cancel`,
  `GET /api/account/metrics` (buying power, portfolio value, unrealized/
  realized/daily P/L, total return %, win rate, avg win/loss, profit factor,
  max drawdown).
- New Trade tab UI: account metric cards, live option chain browser, full
  order ticket (side/type/qty/TIF/limit-or-stop fields), working orders +
  history tables, one-click position close from the Dashboard.

## 2026-07-16 — Watchlist manager + in-app trading mode toggle

*Commit `0bc3955`. 272 tests.*

- New `config/runtime.py` `RuntimeSettings`: overlays `data/settings.json`
  onto the yaml-loaded config at bootstrap, mutates the live config object
  under the server lock so changes apply on the next cycle with **no
  restart**. Baseline snapshot (pre-overlay yaml values) lets `custom` mode
  restore exact yaml values when switching away.
- New `data/symbols.py` + bundled 12,472-symbol NASDAQ/NYSE directory
  (`optionspilot/data_assets/symbols.csv`) for instant, offline ticker validation and
  autocomplete search.
- Watchlist manager: quick-add with autocomplete, bulk paste parsing
  (comma/space/newline), per-symbol valid/duplicate/invalid reporting, 9
  preset lists (Magnificent 7, S&P 500 Leaders, AI Stocks, etc.) + saved
  Favorites, pin/drag-reorder/sort/filter, keyboard shortcuts, 30-symbol
  cap, background name + market-cap metadata fetch.
- Trading-mode segmented control (Conservative / High-Risk / Custom) in the
  header and Settings tab, with an advanced tuning panel for Custom mode
  (six validated risk/engine fields). Switches apply instantly and persist.
- Build script hardening: bundles `data_assets`, backs up/restores the exe's
  `data/` folder across rebuilds, refuses to build over a running instance.

## 2026-07-14 — Trading modes: Conservative and High-Risk

*Commit `70abb06`. 239 tests.*

- New `engine/gate.py` `TradeGate`: Conservative mode keeps the fixed
  `min_confidence` bar (default 80%). High-Risk mode adapts the required
  confidence to a deterministic *setup quality* classification (excellent/
  good/average/poor) built from evidence composition — poor setups
  (opposing HTF trend, 3+ conflicting indicators, or too few core
  confirmations) never trade at any confidence; entries below the
  conservative bar also require risk/reward ≥ a configurable threshold.
- Every gate decision produces a `GateReport` (quality, threshold used,
  passed/failed confirmations, one-line reason) that flows into logs, scan
  summaries, journal `market_conditions`, and the dashboard.
- Conservative mode's behavior is byte-identical to pre-existing behavior —
  this was an additive change, not a rewrite of the scorer.

## 2026-07-11 — Phase 8: hardening

*Commit `268cac9` (+ `30cd974`, `39640ee`). 225 tests.*

- `scripts/soak.py`: repeated live-cycle harness tracking exceptions, heap
  growth, and per-cycle timing — first run: 8 cycles, 0 failures,
  +0.2 MB heap growth, ~15.5s/cycle.
- `/webhook/tradingview`: secret-validated (constant-time compare),
  config-gated inbound alert endpoint. An alert only *triggers a scan* of
  that symbol through the normal engine + risk pipeline — it can never
  place an order directly.
- `broker/registry.py`: `create_broker()` factory with Alpaca/Tradier/
  Webull/IBKR extension slots that raise `BrokerError` with guidance rather
  than silently no-op-ing; the live-trading gate is re-checked at
  construction time as defense in depth.
- Performance: vectorized the smart-money detectors (numpy instead of
  per-row pandas/`iterrows`) and capped `MultiTimeframeAnalyzer` to the
  trailing 400 bars — backtest time on 520 bars dropped from 7.9s to 4.7s
  with identical trade output.

## 2026-07-11 — Initial commit: phases 1–7

*Commit `40eb1ea`. 204 tests.*

The original v1 build in one commit: multi-timeframe technical/structural/
smart-money analysis suite, confluence-scored AI decision engine
(`ConfluenceScorer`), risk-gated paper execution (`RiskManager` +
`PaperBroker`), SQLite trade journal, bounded/auditable learning system
(evidence-weight tuning from journal history), event-driven backtester
sharing the live engine code, orchestrator + desktop/email notifications,
full CLI (`run`/`scan`/`status`/`journal`/`backtest`/`learn`), and a packaged
desktop dashboard (FastAPI + pywebview + PyInstaller). Paper trading only —
no live-broker code path exists anywhere in this codebase by design.
