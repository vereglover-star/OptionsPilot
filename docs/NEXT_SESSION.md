# NEXT_SESSION.md — start here

Concise session-to-session handoff. Keep this current — update it at the end
of every significant session, not "later." For the detailed narrative behind
any of this, see `PROJECT_STATE.md`; for the structured snapshot, see
`PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

**Last updated:** 2026-07-18, packaging-fix session (release-blocking
"No module named 'yfinance'" in the packaged exe — root-caused and fixed).

## What was completed?

The **V3 product-quality sprint**, on branch **`v3-ui`** (deliberately not
merged to `main` — the user asked for the redesign to stay isolated until
reviewed and approved). Seven milestones, each built → verified in a real
browser → committed separately:

1. **V3-0 `7176843` — chart reliability.** The "app opens with no usable
   charts" bug was root-caused (not guessed): yfinance returns *empty*
   frames on transient failures, `CachedProvider` memoized those empties
   for the full TTL (poisoning retries), the disk cache was never used as
   a fallback, and the frontend had no catch/retry and silently dropped
   mid-load switches. Fixed at all four layers; the canvas can no longer
   be silently blank (loading overlay → error overlay with Retry → stale
   banner), charts auto-refresh every 30s preserving zoom. The engine's
   strict fail-closed data path is unchanged (tested explicitly).
2. **V3-1 `e06031c` — design system.** Type/spacing/elevation tokens,
   inline-SVG icon nav, 56px collapsed rail below 1180px, and a real
   pre-existing flex/grid min-width blowout fixed (`main{min-width:0}`,
   `minmax(0,1fr)`).
3. **V3-2 `641d617` — dashboard.** 2:1 layout, AI-opportunities and
   watchlist-movers side rail, action-oriented empty states.
4. **V3-3 `629c19d` — trade screen.** ATM quick-picks, risk-vs-buying-power
   line, on-tab positions with close-prefill, B/S/+/−/Enter order keys.
5. **V3-4 `a365871` — settings.** Grouped searchable config cards replace
   the JSON dump; live-trading flags visibly locked (🔒 off by design).
6. **V3-5 `776d23d` — analytics.** Coach first-run explainer, journal
   filters + cumulative-P&L curve, backtest drawdown/exit-reason panels,
   learning weight-shift bars.
7. **V3-6 `79138da` — accessibility.** Skip link, toast live region,
   `scope="col"` everywhere, `aria-current`, `?` shortcut overlay.
8. **V3-7 — pre-merge audit fixes.** A full senior-review pass over the
   branch found and fixed three real issues: `CandleCache` was unusable
   from worker threads (`check_same_thread` — the disk cache silently
   never worked in the live app, and V3-0's stale fallback would have
   returned empty in production; fixed with a locked shared connection +
   threading regression test), the chart's 30s timer never auto-retried a
   failed *first* load, and Enter could submit an order from behind the
   `?` overlay. Each fix browser- or thread-verified individually.

The audit that scoped all of this is `ROADMAP-V3-UX.md` (committed with
V3-0).

9. **Packaging fix (2026-07-18, this session, uncommitted).** The user
   found the freshly built exe unusable: every chart/quote/chain request
   failed with "No module named 'yfinance'". Root cause: the performance
   pass (`f1bae42`) made the yfinance import lazy via
   `importlib.import_module`, which PyInstaller cannot see, so every exe
   built since then silently shipped without yfinance. Fixed with
   `--collect-all yfinance` in `scripts/build_exe.ps1`; a new `selftest`
   CLI command that the build script now runs against the fresh exe
   (build fails on an incomplete bundle); and `tests/test_packaging.py`
   (+4 tests — fails the ordinary suite if any dynamic third-party
   import isn't collected). Exe rebuilt and verified live: candles
   (daily + 5m) and a 231-contract chain served from the packaged app;
   full browser flow sweep of the chart system green. **356 tests.**

## What is currently stable?

Everything on both branches. **356 tests pass** (+6 cached-provider tests and a CandleCache threading regression test
added in V3-0, +4 packaging-guard tests added 2026-07-18). `scripts/verify.ps1` ran clean end-to-end as the closing
action of the session, and every milestone additionally got scenario-level
Playwright verification (chart failure states, the full order-ticket flow —
including the manual-entry risk gate visibly rejecting an after-hours
order, which is correct behavior — settings search, a real 25-day backtest
run, the accessibility overlay).

## What should be worked on next?

1. **The user reviews the `v3-ui` branch** (run `.\scripts\dev.ps1` on the
   branch and click through) and decides on merging to `main`. Nothing
   should be built on top of `v3-ui` until that call is made.
2. Remaining, explicitly-not-done `ROADMAP-V3-UX.md` items if the user
   wants V3 continued: **H5** notification center with persistence (needs
   a small backend store — check `optionspilot/notify/` first), **N2**
   chart↔option-chain cross-links, **N4** toast stacking.
3. One deliberately-skipped verification: the order-ticket **fill** path
   (fill → stop-loss pre-arm → position row) was verified only up to the
   risk-gate rejection because the market was closed during the session —
   worth one manual market-hours pass.
4. Then the standing scope decision (unchanged from before V3): V2-5
   replay engine, V2-6 journal/improvement dashboard, the deferred V2-4
   workspace layout, or letting paper-trading data accumulate.

## What files are currently important?

- `optionspilot/ui/static/index.html` — the entire frontend; V3 touched
  every tab. The chart lifecycle (`loadChart`, `chOverlay`, `chStale`,
  generation counter `CH.gen`) is the most intricate new code.
- `optionspilot/data/cached.py` — `EMPTY_CANDLE_TTL` and
  `get_candles_stale_ok()` are new; the strict `get_candles` contract is
  unchanged and must stay that way (fail-closed trading).
- `scripts/verify.ps1` — still the "is the repo healthy" command.
- `docs/ROADMAP-V3-UX.md` — the audit + scope this sprint implemented;
  the unimplemented remainder lives there.

## What should NOT be modified?

See `AI_CONTEXT.md` "Things future AI assistants should never change
without careful review." New this session: **do not relax
`CachedProvider.get_candles` to serve stale data** — the stale fallback
exists only behind `get_candles_stale_ok()` for display surfaces, and the
engine's empty-means-skip behavior is load-bearing for trading safety.

## Known issues

- **The 2026-07-18 packaging fix is uncommitted** (build_exe.ps1,
  __main__.py `selftest`, tests/test_packaging.py, doc updates, plus the
  untracked `ARCHITECTURE-MOBILE.md` proposal) — commit when the user
  says so.
- `OptionsPilot.exe serve` (the windowed exe running the browser-serve
  subcommand) starts its internals but never binds the port —
  pre-existing, discovered 2026-07-18 while verifying the packaging fix.
  Desktop `ui` mode and dev-repo `python -m optionspilot serve` both
  work. Tracked in `TODO.md`.
- The Trade tab's fill-path UX (post-fill stop-loss pre-arm) has no
  market-hours verification from this session (see above).
- Frontend coverage remains shallow relative to the app's size
  (`browser_check.py` is tab-navigation only) — the session's per-flow
  Playwright scripts live in the session scratchpad, not the repo; making
  them permanent is a natural follow-up (see `TODO.md`).
- No CI / linting — still deliberate, still just recommended
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Suggested first prompt for the next AI session

> Read `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and this file, then run
> `git log --oneline -10`, `git status`, `git branch --show-current`, and
> `git diff --stat` yourself — note that V3 work lives on the `v3-ui`
> branch, not `main` — then run `.\scripts\verify.ps1` to confirm the
> baseline is green. Then: [either "the v3-ui branch is approved — merge
> it to main," or a specific next task]. If no task is given, ask whether
> the V3 branch has been reviewed before proposing anything built on it.
